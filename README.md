Under supervision of Dr. Paulo Loureiro de Sousa

## Description

This is a temporary repository for the project on Brain Activity Review.
You'll find here the PDF files listing the techniques.

To select them, we used a set of constraints:

* In vivo, from C. elegans to humans.
* Physiologically agnostic.
* Allows for more than one sampling within 1 hour.

For interference techniques, the requirement was simply transient interference, respecting the same temporal constraints listed above.

## Goals

Currently, we're preparing a draft and deciding whether to publish it as a paper or as a wiki-like page to allow for community interaction.

Feel free to use the list as you see fit. If you want to build on it to return something to the neuroscience community, just reach out to us!

_Updates Soon_

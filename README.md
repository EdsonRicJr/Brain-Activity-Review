## Description

This is a temporary repository for the project on Brain Activity Review.
You'll find here the PDF files listing the techniques, organized from the first to the last steps (to date). For all useful purposes, use only the last step (4th), as it is the most organized.

To select them, we used a set of constraints:

* In vivo, from C. elegans to humans.
* Physiologically agnostic.
* Allows for more than one sampling within 1 hour.

For interference techniques, the requirement was simply transient interference, respecting the same temporal constraints listed above.

## Goals

Currently, we're preparing a draft and deciding whether to publish it as a paper or as a wiki-like page to allow for community interaction. There is also the need to better organize the hierarchical structure of the techniques within the last step file.

Feel free to use the list as you see fit. If you want to build on it, just reach out to us!
